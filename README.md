# NLP Bag of Words from Scratch

BOW or Bag of Words is one of the many strategies used in NLP (Natural Language Processing) to convert a text document into a readable numerical format, so that computer programs can understand it.

It is a component readily available in ScikitLearn or the now-deprecated Sklearn for programmers and researchers to use. However, in a current course, we were given the task of implementing it from scratch in Python and within a restricted skeleton code.

I compiled my attempts and the final code in this #Github repository. Pardon my noob skills!
